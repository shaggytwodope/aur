### Your anidb login

### Base paths for the organize-option

# just set the same path for both.

#basepath_series ~/anime/series

### Optional settings
# Where should kiara cache file meta-data?
# It is safe to share this path with multible users.
#database ~/.kiara.db

# Location of the socket that's used to communicate with the backend
#session ~/.kiara.session

# The anidb api endpoint. This is configurable as per anidb recommandations,
# though there should be no reason to change this.
