Building VLMC

Dependencies
============

- Latest version of VLC installed (from the git repository)

Get the sources
===============

  git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlmc.git

Building and packaging VLMC on Linux
====================================

A typical way to build VLMC is:
  mkdir build && cd build

To set install path: (optional)
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

Else:
  cmake ..

Build:
  make

To package:
  make package

But this by default will search for available pkg builders and build accordingly.

To force building deb:
  cpack -G DEB
To force building rpm:
  cpack -G RPM
   
Installing on Linux
===================

On Linux:
  dpkg -i <deb package>
  rpm -i <rpm package>

To remove:
  dpkg -r vlmc
  rpm -e vlmc


Running VLMC
============

	./vlmc
