Usage:
    shalarm [OPTION / TIME]


Requirements:
    You'll need a media player of some sort to actually get anything out of this
    script.  I recommend 'mplayer' or something similar.  If you want to use the
    'FORTUNE' option in the config file, you'll also need the fortune program
    installed.


Installation:
    You don't really need to install this (it's a shell script), but it makes
    things a little easier if you do.  To do so, as superuser and within the
    root directory to which you've extracted the archive, type 'make install'.


Uninstallation:
    Similar to the above, except you type 'make uninstall' instead.


Description:
    It's just an alarm clock written as a bash script.  Use it however you'd use
    an alarm.  Alarms are typically used to cancel sleep.

    I'd recommend trying it with the --test option before attempting to use this
    in any serious capacity, however.

    NOTE:  All times are in 24-hour format.


Arguments:
    -h or --help:
        Print a help screen

    -v or --version:
        Print version and author info

    -d or --debug:
        Print out some information about what the script is trying to do.

    -t or --test:
        Test out the alarm (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

    --snooze N:
        Enable snooze, set snooze length to N seconds

    --timeout N:
        Enable alarm timeout, set timeout limit to N seconds


Examples:
    shalarm 14
        Set the alarm for 14:00 (2:00 PM).
    shalarm 1430
        Set the alarm for 14:30 (2:30 PM).
    shalarm 143030
        Set the alarm for 9:00 PM.  Just kidding.  14:30:30 (2:30:30 PM).
    shalarm --snooze 300 --timeout 900 07:30
        Set the alarm for 7:30 AM.  Additionally, both snooze and alarm timeout
        are enabled.  When you snooze (the first CTRL-C), the alarm will silence
        itself for 300 seconds (5 minutes).  If left ringing for 900 seconds (15
        minutes), the alarm will terminate itself.



Configuration:
    Configuration files are stored at /etc/shalarm.cfg and
    $HOME/.config/shalarm/shalarm.cfg.  The second file takes precedence over
    the first.  While a configuration file isn't strictly required, it's highly
    recommended that you use it since it contains a couple of things not
    presently supported by command-line arguments.

    Initially the config file is installed to /etc/shalarm.cfg, but the
    user-modifiable version is copied to $HOME/.config/shalarm/shalarm.cfg the
    first time the script is run, including with the --test option.  It's
    probably a good idea to run the test before anything else.
