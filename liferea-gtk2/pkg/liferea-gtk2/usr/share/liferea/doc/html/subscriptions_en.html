	<h3>Things Liferea Can Subscribe To</h3>
	<p>
	As a news aggregator Liferea allows you to subscribe to different
	syndication sources. The most common use case is to subscribe to
	single feeds. But Liferea also supports subscribing a source that provides
	a collection of feeds. So you can subscribe to:
	
	<ul>
		<li>a single feed</li>
		<li>any OPML source (a planet feed list, a blog roll...)</li>
		<li>a <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> subscription list</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Subscribing to a Feed</h3>
	<p>
	To create a new feed subscription select "New Feed" from the feed 
	list's contextual menu or the "Subscriptions" menu. A dialog to create a 
	new subscription will appear.
	</p>	

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_subscribe_1.6.0.png">
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For example, to subscribe to Slashdot's news feed enter
	"<i><a href="http://slashdot.org/index.rss">http://slashdot.org/index.rss</a></i>"
	into the text box and click "OK".
	</p>
	
	<h3>Creating Special Feed Subscriptions</h3>

	<p>
	Liferea supports obtaining feeds from a variety of different sources 
	including Internet URLs, the output of a locally run command, and by 
	directly reading from a	file. Most often, it is desired to subscribe 
	using an URL as described in the previous paragraph. For special 
	subscription you must select "Advanced" to open the following more
	complex subscription dialog:</p>
	
	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_subscribe_adv_1.6.0.png">
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After selecting the desired source type, enter the source URL, command
	name, or filename into the "Source" textbox. </p>
	
	<p>When a command or local file is selected, the command or file
	can be selected using a file navigation box by clicking "Select
	File...".</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes, the data in a feed is in a format that is
	unknown to Liferea. If this is the case, a conversion filter
	can be used to convert the data into a useable format. Many
	filters can be downloaded from <a
	href="http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/software/snownews/snowscripts/">the
	Snownews and Liferea script repository</a>.</p>

	<p>To use conversion filters, the "Use conversion filter" option needs
	to be activated in the subscription dialog box. The filter is
	specified by either typing the path of the filter script into the
	"Convert using" textbox or selecting the filter after clicking the
	"Select File..." button. The filters are simple programs that read
	the non-supported feed format using stdin and output the valid
	feed to stdout. Conversion filters are often written using
	perl. </p>
	
	<h3>Changing Subscription Properties</h3>

	<p>
	The feed properties dialog is used to configure additional feed
	properties and can be activated in the "Subscriptions" menu or from feed 
	context menu. After successfully creating a new subscription you 
	usually don't need to change the feed properties.
	</p>
	<p>
	Only if you want to change the HTTP authentication, the caching behaviour
	or other feed specific options then you need to use the feed properties
	dialog.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The dialog groups the feed properties into five sets: "General",
	"Source", "Archive", "Download" and "Advanced":</p>

	<h4>General Properties</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_general_1.6.0.png"/>
	</p>
	
	<p>The "General" pane allows you to set feed title and update
	interval. The feed name is is the feed's name shown in the feed
	list. Multiple feeds can have the same name.</p>
	
	<a name="updateInterval">
	<div id="updateInterval"><p>The feed update interval controls how often Liferea attempts to
		update a feed. Typically, the feed update interval can be left at
		its default. We recommend to use the global update interval
		preference which you can find in the preference dialog because it
		allows one to change the update interval of all feed
		simultaneously.</p>
	  
	  <p>Sometimes a feed provides a feed specific update interval.
		If this is the case Liferea automatically activates the user
		defined update interval setting and enters the feed specific
		update interval. This is only done during the initial feed
		subscription. You should never need to change such a setting.</p>

		<p>The update interval can be set using the following options:</p>
		<dl>
		  <dt>Use global default update interval</dt>
		  <dd>This preference is used for all feeds that have
			the update interval setting to follow the global default update
			interval setting.</dd>
		  
		  <dt>Feed specific update interval</dt><dd>There might be situations where you want to specify
			a update interval which might be more or less frequent than
			the global update interval. Then you should select the user
			defined interval option and enter the interval value you want.
			<em>When specifying an update interval, you should consider the
			  web traffic you will cause with an inappropiate update
			  interval. Don't update more often than the feed's content is
			  updated.</em></dd>
	
		  <dt>Don't update this feed automatically</dt><dd>This option
			allows you to prevent updating the feed. You can use this option
			for feeds you always want to have only updated manually.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</div>
	<h4>Source Properties</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_source_1.6.0.png"/>
	</p>
	
	<p>The "Source" pane contains the same fields that the advanced
	subscription dialog provides. You can use these	settings to change 
	the feed source (e.g. after a feed's URL has changed).</p>

	<h4>Archive Properties</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_cache_1.6.0.png"/>
	</p>
	
	<p>The third pane, "Archive", controls how many items of
	a feed are kept when Liferea saves a feed to disk.
	Similar to the update interval settings there is a 
	corresponding global preference which sets a default cache
	size for all feeds. You should use the feed specific cache
	settings only to implement exceptions from the global
	default cache size.</p>
	
	<dl>
	  <dt>Default Cache Settings</dt><dd>Makes the feed use the default cache settings, which are stored in the main Liferea
		preferences.</dd>
	  <dt>Disable Cache</dt> <dd> Disable the feed's items from ever being saved.</dd>
	  <dt>Unlimited cache</dt> <dd> Save all items ever downloaded. </dd>
	  <dt>Number of items to save</dt> <dd>Limits the cache size to a fixed number.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Flagged items are always saved, regardless
	of the cache settings.  So if you have found an important headline
	and want to prevent it from being dropped from the cache just flag
	this headline.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Download Properties</h4>
	
	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_downl_1.6.0.png"/>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This tab allows you to disable the use of the global proxy setting and
	to enable HTTP authentication when downloading the feed. Enable the checkbox 
	and enter appropriate user and password values to use pasword-protected feeds. 
	Usually you won't need to use these settings because you will be asked username 
	and password when subscribing to the feed that requires	authentication.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Advanced Properties</h4>
	
	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_adv_1.6.0.png"/>
	</p>

	<p>
	This panel provides different special options to control how Liferea
	handles the subscription. These options are:
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Automatically download all enclosures of this feed.</dt>
		<dd>This might be useful for podcasts or torrent feeds. If
		you enable the option Liferea downloads attached <a href="enclosures_en.html">enclosures</a>.
		</dd>
	
		<dt>Auto-load item link in configured browser when selecting articles.</dt>
		<dd>Per-default Liferea shows the item description in the HTML view pane.
		When this check box is enabled it will automatically load the item link
		when the item selection changes.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Ignore comment feeds for this subscription.</dt>
		<dd>Sometimes there are feeds with broken or useless
		comment feeds. This option allows to ignore those.</dd>
		
		<dt>Enforce popup notification for this subscription.</dt>
		<dd>If the global notification preference is disabled you
		can enabled this option to generate notifications for only
		this feed.</dd>
		
		<dt>Never do popup notification for this subscription.</dt>
		<dd>If the global notification preference is enabled you
		can use this option to prevent notifications for this feed.
		This might be useful for high-traffic feeds.</dd>
		
		<dt>Mark downloaded items as read.</dt>
		<dd>Normally new items have the status "unread". Sometimes
		you might want to use this option for new items of a special
		feed not to show up as "unread" so you don't have to mark
		them "read" manually.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h3>Subscribing to OPML Sources and Google Reader Accounts</h3>
	<p>
	To subscribe to OPML feed lists or a Google Reader account
	select "New Source" from the context menu of the feed list or from the
	"Subscriptions" menu. From the following dialog select the source type
	you like to create.
	</p>
	
	<h4>OPML Sources</h3>
	<p>
	If you have selected "Planet/BlogRoll/OPML" you need to supply the source
	URL of the OPML document. If necessary provide authentication information.
	After doing so a new OPML source node will be inserted in the feed list 
	and after downloading the OPML document for the first time new 
	subscriptions as described by the OPML source will be created. If the
	OPML feed list changes over time old subscriptions are automatically
	dropped and new ones are added.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Google Reader</h4>
	<p>
	If you have selected "Google Reader" you just need to supply your Google Reader
	username and password. Similar to the OPML source Liferea will automatically
	retrieve the Google Reader subscription list and will automatically add all
	Google Reader subscriptions.
	<br /><br />
	<b>Note: If you delete feeds or items in the "Google Reader" subscription
	from within Liferea they will <b>also</b> be deleted in you Google Reader
	account!</b>
